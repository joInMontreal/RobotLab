Version 1.1, 9 april
	* Standard libraries Working ( Lib motor, Lib Servo, Lib Sonar)
	* Things to do : * Add Lib Captor
	
To compile the program :
# make
To Execute 
# ./run_ROVER		 




********** Example To Test The libraries Sensor without the Sensor *****************
* On the BBB, connect P9_27(READ_PORT_PRU) with P9_14(PWM)

* In the Rover_main.c file, add call function:
test_Sonar();

* Compile the program :
# make

Launch program run_Rover  ():
 #./run_ROVER

In the screen you will see this commment line :	
	INFO: PRU completed transfer.

PRU Program	is waiting for a signal


* Open an other Console Command, we want to generate a 10 MHZ PWM signal 
#cd /sys/devices/ocp.3/pwm_test_P9_14.11

// Inside pwm_test_P9_14.11 Folder
# echo 0 > run				// Stop Pwm Signal
# echo 0 > polarity			// Set Polarity to Low level
# echo 10000000 > period	// Set Period to 10 MHZ
# echo 5000000 > duty		// Set duty to 50% of the Period (10000000/2 -> 5000000)
# echo 1 > run				// Launch Signal

* Go back to the 1st command console, and If all is ok, you will see a value about 4977us and a distance of 85.04 (About):
 Time : 4977 us , Distance : 85.04 cm
 test_Sonar :  Distance = 85.04 cm
